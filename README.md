# Decentralized Voting System

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a decentralized voting system smart contract using Solidity.

## Design Choices

## Security Considerations

## Test Cases

### Key Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register to vote, ensuring that only eligible participants can cast their votes.

- **Candidate Management**: The owner of the contract has the authority to add candidates to the election, allowing for a dynamic list of candidates.

- **Secure Voting**: Registered voters can securely cast their votes for their preferred candidate, with mechanisms in place to prevent multiple votes from the same user.

- **Transparency**: The voting process is transparent, ensuring that the results are publicly accessible to maintain trust in the election process.

## Implementation

The implementation of this decentralized voting system is done using Solidity, a popular programming language for creating smart contracts on blockchain platforms. The contract employs appropriate data structures to store voter information and election results. Events are used to log important actions, providing transparency and auditability.

## Requirements

The project's requirements include:

- Implementation of the smart contract in Solidity.
- Proper use of data structures to store voter information and election results.
- Ensuring that voters can only cast one vote.
- Inclusion of events to log essential actions during the voting process.
